The main goal of Zk Chickens is to **create a player economy where some players earn from their skills while enjoying casual gameplay.** Many other blockchain games failed to deliver a sustainable economy but we had our lesson from them.

### Lessons
#### Inflation
More than **500% or even 1000% inflation** is leading to an end. Naturally.

In our project, we have a 3.34% team allocation with a 2-year linear vesting period which generates **only 1.67% inflation!**

One other allocation is tester rewards (0.66% of total supply) which has 100% unlock at TGE and **doesn't generate any inflation.**

And our 3rd allocation is the Game Rewards allocation with %96 of the total supply. And it **doesn't generate any inflation** as well! Even though it is **%100 LOCKED** from the beginning!

So, yes! **We only have 1.67% inflation** with 99.34% locked tokens! It might sound odd or impossible but you can learn how we do that in [our Whitepaper](https://bora-oezenbirkan.gitbook.io/zk-chickens/). Check the Tokenomics section!

#### Game Rewards
There are different approaches when it comes to distributing the game rewards. Some unsustainable projects like Axie Infinity chose to **have a secondary token as a game reward and minted it infinitely for each player.** The problem with this approach is obvious, the token supply increases with the growth but when the growth stops or even starts to decline, you have left with loads of tokens. The result is clear. A collapse.

The other common approach is to **distribute a fixed amount of game reward (unlocked amount for each week) to top players.** Let's say the top 100 players. This approach's problem is that it limits growth. Although this is not the case for some games for many games, if only the top 100 earn money from the game, the remaining players feel discouraged to play the game. More player means lower chances to get in the top 100. Which limits the growth quite much!

**Our solution is fair and even brings the game new excitement!** We are distributing the game rewards to X number of players but not the top X, a random X number of players of that week! We have a lottery system for that. When a player wins a match, he earns an egg. Each egg represents a ticket for that week's lottery. The more eggs you have, the higher your chances you'll get in the lottery!

In this way, we do not mint/unlock an infinite number of tokens to distribute to everyone or we do not discourage the majority of the players! Everyone has a chance to earn in this game! Waiting for lottery results for each week is quite exciting as well!

## And more!

## Challenges and Implementation
âœ… Making a **multiplayer** game is a hard task! I have done it by using Photon Network.

âœ… **Smart Contracts and Tokenomics:** Sustainable tokenomics is a real challenge. I have designed a tokenomics that will not collapse due to high inflation! A Treasury contract to provide and distribute game rewards!

âœ… **Lottery System:** I've developed a lottery system to distribute the game rewards among players. This system motivates all players to play and provides a fair system and weekly excitement for gamers!

âœ… **Community/Clan System:** Current community system incentivizes the community leaders to bring their folks to the game and play together and earn together. Like Bitcoin mining pools! This system boosts growth incredibly!

âœ… **Dynamic admin settings:** I can change most of the game settings via the Database instantly. Player counts per match, player speed, health, damage, etc.

âœ… User **authentication** and **Database** with Firebase.
